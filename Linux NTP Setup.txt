## To setup NTP on app server 2, I used yum package installer to install ntp and added the provided ntp server 1.sg.pool.ntp.org to the /etc/ntp.conf file.

- Login to app server 2 as root
=> ssh username@server2
=> sudo su

- Check if ntp package is installed already
=> rpm -qa | grep ntp

- Install ntp package on app server 2
=> yum install ntp -y

- Check the status of ntp
=> systemctl status ntpd

- As ntp is disabled, enable it
=> systemctl enable ntp 


Note: I did not start ntp because of the instructions not to start, restart or stop it.
