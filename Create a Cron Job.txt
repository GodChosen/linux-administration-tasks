## To create a cron job, I had to install the cronie package, since it was not installed yet. Then, I started and enabled the crond service as well as confirmed that it was enabled. Then I proceeded to create the cron job for root user.

- Login to app server 1 as root user
=> ssh username@server1
=> sudo su

- Confirmed that the cronie package was not installed
=> rpm -qa | grep croonie

- Installed cronie package on the app server
=> yum install cronie -y

- Start and Enable crond service
=> systemctl start crond
=> systemctl enable crond

- Confirm crond service is up and running
=> systemctl status crond

- Add the given cron job for the root user
=> crontab -e
=> Add '*/5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text' to the file
=> Press Escape key
=> Press ':wq' to save and exit

- Confirm the cron job has been added for the user
=> crontab -l

Note: To confirm other users cron jobs, use the following:
=> crontab -u username -l
