## To fix the issue with the mail server, I checked the status and it was down. On trying to start the server, I got an error which when checked pointed me to the issue. See details of how I fixed it below:

- Login to the Mail server as root
=> ssh username@server1
=> sudo su

- Confirmed the status of Psotfix
=> systemctl status postfix

- As it was disabled and inactive, I tried to start and enable the mariadb service
=> systemctl start postfix
=> systemctl enable postfix

As the server failed to start, I checked the logs as follows:
- Inspected the logs for error message that could point me to the solution
=> journalctl -xe -u postfix

- I noticed that there were some permission denied leading to error as seen below:

newaliases: fatal: parameter inet_interfaces: no local interface found for ::1

- To solve the issue, I opened the /etc/postfix/mail.cf file
=> vi /etc/postfix/mail.cf

- Search the file for the line with /inet_interfaces = localhost and add # to the beginning
=> #inet_interfaces = localhost
=> Press Escape
=> Press ':wq'

- I tried to start and enable the postfix service again and was successful
=> systemctl start postfix
=> systemctl enable postfix

- I confirmed the status of mariadb service
=> systemctl status postfix
