## To perform the given task, I performed the actions below:

- Identify the server where Apache is not running
=> telnet stapp01 5000
=> telnet stapp02 5000
=> telnet stapp03 5000

- Login to the app server 1 as root
=> ssh username@appserver1
=> sudo su

- Start apache on server 1
=> systemctl restart httpd
=> systemctl status httpd

- From the status, it is clear that another service is using the port 5000
-Find the process using the port
=> netstat -tulnp

- From the above, the sendmail service is using the port 5000
- Find out the PID of the process and kill the process
=> ps -ef | grep sendmail
=> kill {PID} 

- Restart the apache (httpd) service
=> systemctl restart httpd
=> systemctl status httpd

- Logout from server 1
=> telnet server1-hostname 5000
