## To substitute each occurence of the text 'Random' with the text 'Sonar', I would made use of the 'sed' command.

- Login to the server as root
=> ssh username@dbserver
=> sudo su -

- Search for the text 'Random' in the provided file
=> cat nautilus.xml | grep Random

- Substitute the text 'Random' with the text 'Sonar'
=> sed -i 's/Random/Sonar/g' /root/nautilus.xml

- Confirm the text Random has been replaced by searching using the command we ran before
=> cat nautilus.xml | grep Random
=> cat nautilus.xml | grep Sonar
