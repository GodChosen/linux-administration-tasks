## To ensure each server can boot in GUI, we would run the following command on all the App servers in the Stratos Datacenter

- Login to server as root
>> ssh username@IP
>> sudo su -

- Confirm the default run level
>> systemctl get-default

- Confirm the status of graphical.target
>> systemctl status graphical.target

- Set the run level to graphical.target
>> systemctl set-default graphical.target

- Start and enable the graphical.target 
>> systemctl start graphical.target
>> systemctl enable graphical.target

- Confirm graphical.target is now set as default run level and enabled
>> systemctl get-default
>> systemctl status graphical.target

NOTE: Repeat steps above for all App servers
