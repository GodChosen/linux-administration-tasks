## To complete the task, I did the following:

- Login to app server 3 as root
=> ssh username@app-server3
=> sudo su

- I confirmed the Apache status in the server
=> systemctl status httpd

- Navigated to the httpd.conf file to make changes
=> vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

/IncludeOptional conf.d/*.conf
i
- Click Enter at the end of that line and add the following

=> ServerSignature Off
=> ServerTokens Prod
=> Esc
=> /Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
=> delete 'Indexes' from the line above
=> :wq

- Start httpd service
=> systemctl start httpd
