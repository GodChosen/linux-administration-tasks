## To fix the issue, I had to follow the steps below:

- Login to the DB server as root
=> ssh username@server1
=> sudo su

- Confirmed the status of MariaDB
=> systemctl status mariadb

- As it was disabled and inactive, I tried to start and enable the mariadb service
=> systemctl start mariadb
=> systemctl enable mariadb

As the server failed to start, I checked the logs as follows:
- Inspected the logs for error message that could point me to the solution
=> journalctl -xe -u mariadb
=> cd /var/run | cat mariadb/mariadb.log

- I noticed that there were some permission denied leading to error as seen below

220318  0:45:20 [ERROR] mysqld: Can't create/write to file '/var/run/mariadb/mariadb.pid' (Errcode: 13)
220318  0:45:20 [ERROR] Can't start server: can't create PID file: Permission denied
220318 00:45:20 mysqld_safe mysqld from pid file /var/run/mariadb/mariadb.pid ended

- To solve the issue, I checked the ownership and permission of the file
=> ls -al
750

- Then I granted write permission to the mysql group
=> chmod 770 /var/run/mariadb

- I tried to start and enable the mariadb service again and was successful
=> systemctl start mariadb
=> systemctl enable mariadb

- I confirmed the status of mariadb service
=> systemctl status mariadb
