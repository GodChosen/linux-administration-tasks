## To achieve the assignment, I used the -M flag in creating the user, as it would ensure the user directory won't be created in the home directory.

- Login to the server
=> ssh username@server-name
=> sudo su -

- Create user anita
=> useradd -M anita

- Confirm user is created by inspecting the /etc/passwd file
=> cat /etc/passwd

- Confirm that user anita has no user directory in home
=> cd /home/
=> ls -alh
