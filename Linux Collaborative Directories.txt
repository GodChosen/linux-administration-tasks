## To fix the issue, I had to follow the steps below:

- Login to the DB server as root
=> ssh username@server1
=> sudo su

- Create the directory /dbadmin/data
=> mkdir -p /dbadmin/data

- Check the directory ownership and permission
=> ls -al /dbadmin/data

- Change the group ownership of the directory
=> chown -R root:dbadmin /dbadmin/data

- Change the directory permission for the group
=> chmod 770 /dbadmin/data

- Confirm directory ownership and permission
=> ls -al /dbadmin/data
