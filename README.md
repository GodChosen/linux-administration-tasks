**KodeKloud-Engineer Linux Tasks**

**#1 Linux Run Levels**

 New tools have been installed on the app server in Stratos Datacenter. Some of these tools can only be managed from the graphical user interface. Therefore, there are requirements for these app servers.

On all App servers in Stratos Datacenter change the default run level so that they can boot in GUI (graphical user interface) by default.


**#2 Linux Remote Copy**

One of the Nautilus developers has copied confidential data on the jump host in Stratos DC. That data must be copied to one of the app servers. Because developers do not have access to app servers, they asked the system admins team to accomplish the task for them.

Copy /tmp/nautilus.txt.gpg file from jump server to App Server 1 at location /home/webapp.


**#3 Linux User Without Home**

The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up a new tool on all app servers, as they have a requirement to create a service user account that will be used by that tool. They are finished with all apps except for App 2 in Stratos Datacenter.

Create a user named anita in App Server 2 without a home directory.


**#4 Linux Services**

 As per details shared by the development team, the new application release has some dependencies on the back end. There are some packages/services that need to be installed on all app servers under Stratos Datacenter. As per requirements please perform the following steps:

a. Install httpd package on all the application servers.

b. Once installed, make sure it is enabled to start during boot.


**#5 Linux String Substitute**

The backup server in the Stratos DC contains several template XML files used by the Nautilus application. However, these template XML files must be populated with valid data before they can be used. One of the daily tasks of a system admin working in the xFusionCorp industries is to apply string and file manipulation commands!

Replace all occurrences of the string Random to Sonar on the XML file /root/nautilus.xml located in the backup server.


**#6 Disable Root Login**

After doing some security audits of servers, xFusionCorp Industries security team has implemented some new security policies. One of them is to disable direct root login through SSH. Disable direct SSH root login on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter.


**#7 SELinux Installation**

xFusionCorp Industries security team recently did a security audit of their infrastructure and they came up with some ideas to improve the application/servers security. They decided to use SElinux for an additional security layer. They are still planning how they will actually go with it however they have decided to start testing with app servers so based on the recommendations they have below given requirements:

Install the required packages of SElinux on App server 1 in Stratos Datacenter and disable it permanently for now, it will be enabled after making some required configuration changes on this host. For now don't worry about rebooting the server since there is already a scheduled reboot tonight in maintenance window. Also ignore the status of SElinux whatever it shows from command line right now but the final status after reboot should be disabled.


**#8 Linux SSH Authentication**

The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up some scripts on jump host that run on regular intervals and perform operations on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter. To make these scripts work properly we need to make sure thor user on jump host haspassword-less SSH access to all app servers through their respective sudo users. Based on the requirements, perform the following:

Set up a password-less authentication for user thor on jump host to all app servers through their respective sudo users.


**#9 Linux NTP Setup**

The system admin team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed an issue with some servers in Stratos Datacenter where some of the servers are not in sync w.r.t time. Because of this, several application functionalities have been impacted. To fix this issue the team has started using common standard NTP servers. They are finished with most of the servers except App Server 2. Therefore, perform the following tasks on this server.

Install and configure NTP server on App Server 2.
Add NTP server 1.sg.pool.ntp.org in NTP configuration on App Server 2.

Please do not try to start/restart/stop ntp service, as we already have a restart for this service scheduled for tonight and we don't want these changes to be applied right now.



**#10 MariaDB Troubleshooting**

There is a critical issue going on with the Nautilus application in Stratos DC. The production support team identified that the application is unable to connect to the database. After digging into the issue, the team found that mariadb service is down on the database server.

Look into the issue and fix the same.


**#11 Linux Postfix Troubleshooting**

Some users of the monitoring app have reported issues with xFusionCorp Industries mail server. They have a mail server in Stork DC where they are using postfix mail transfer agent. Postfix service seems to fail. Try to identify the root cause and fix it



**#12 Linux Collaborative Directories**

The Nautilus team doesn't want its data to be accessed by any of the other groups/teams due to security reasons and want their data to be strictly accessed by the dbadmin group of the team.

Setup a collaborative directory /dbadmin/data on Nautilus App 1 server in Stratos Datacenter.

The directory should be group owned by the group dbadmin and the group should own the files inside the directory. The directory should be read/write/execute to the group owners, and others should not have any access.



**#13 Create a Cron Job**

The Nautilus system admins team has prepared scripts to automate several day-to-day tasks. They want them to be deployed on all app servers in Stratos DC on a set schedule. Before that they need to test similar functionality with a sample cron job. Therefore, perform the steps below:

a. Install cronie package on all Nautilus app servers and start crond service.

b. Add a cron */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text for root user.


**#14 Linux User Expiry**
A developer rose has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for rose. Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with a set expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.

Therefore, create a user named rose on the App Server 1. Set expiry date to 2021-02-17 in Stratos Datacenter. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.


**#15 Linux User Files**

There was some users data copied on Nautilus App Server 3 at /home/usersdata location by the Nautilus production support team in Stratos DC. Later they found that they mistakenly mixed up different user data there. Now they want to filter out some user data and copy it to another location. Find the details below:

On App Server 3 find all files (not directories) owned by user kirsty inside /home/usersdata directory and copy them all while keeping the folder structure (preserve the directories path) to /news directory.



**#16 Apache Redirect**

The Nautilus devops team got some requirements related to some Apache config changes. They need to setup some redirects for some URLs. There might be some more changes need to be done. Below you can find more details regarding that:

httpd is already installed on app server 2. Configure Apache to listen on port 6300.

Configure Apache to add some redirects as mentioned below:

a.) Redirect http://stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:<Port>/ to http://www.stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:<Port>/ i.e non www to www. This must be a permanent redirect i.e 301

b.) Redirect http://www.stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:<Port>/blog/ to http://www.stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com:<Port>/news/. This must be a temporary redirect i.e 302.


**#17 Application Security**

We have a backup management application UI hosted on Nautilus's backup server in Stratos DC. That backup management application code is deployed under Apache on the backup server itself, and Nginx is running as a reverse proxy on the same server. Apache and Nginx ports are 3003 and 8091, respectively. We have iptables firewall installed on this server. Make the appropriate changes to fulfill the requirements mentioned below:

We want to open all incoming connections to Nginx's port and block all incoming connections to Apache's port. Also make sure rules are permanent.



**#18 Linux GPG Encryption**

We have confidential data that needs to be transferred to a remote location, so we need to encrypt that data.We also need to decrypt data we received from a remote location in order to understand its content.

On storage server in Stratos Datacenter we have private and public keys stored /home/*_key.asc. Use those keys to perform the following actions.

Encrypt /home/encrypt_me.txt to /home/encrypted_me.asc.

Decrypt /home/decrypt_me.asc to /home/decrypted_me.txt. (Passphrase for decryption and encryption is kodekloud).


**#19 Web Server Security**

During a recent security audit, the application security team of xFusionCorp Industries found security issues with the Apache web server on Nautilus App Server 3 server in Stratos DC. They have listed several security issues that need to be fixed on this server. Please apply the security settings below:

a. On Nautilus App Server 3 it was identified that the Apache web server is exposing the version number. Ensure this server has the appropriate settings to hide the version number of the Apache web server.

b. There is a website hosted under /var/www/html/blog on App Server 3. It was detected that the directory /blog lists all of its contents while browsing the URL. Disable the directory browser listing in Apache config.

c. Also make sure to restart the Apache service after making the changes.


**#20 Linux Bash Script**

The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries is working on developing some bash scripts to automate different day to day tasks. One is to create a bash script for taking websites backup. They have a static website running on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter, and they need to create a bash script named official_backup.sh which should accomplish the following tasks. (Also remember to place the script under /scripts directory on App Server 2)

a. Create a zip archive named xfusioncorp_official.zip of /var/www/html/official directory.

b. Save the archive in /backup/ on App Server 2. This is a temporary storage, as backups from this location will be clean on weekly basis. Therefore, we also need to save this backup archive on Nautilus Backup Server.

c. Copy the created archive to Nautilus Backup Server server in /backup/ location.

d. Please make sure script won't ask for password while copying the archive file. Additionally, the respective server user (for example, tony in case of App Server 1) must be able to run it.


**#21 Linux Find Command**

During a routine security audit, the team identified an issue on the Nautilus App Server. Some malicious content was identified within the website code. After digging into the issue they found that there might be more infected files. Before doing a cleanup they would like to find all similar files and copy them to a safe location for further investigation. Accomplish the task as per the following requirements:

a. On App Server 2 at location /var/www/html/blog find out all files (not directories) having .js extension.

b. Copy all those files along with their parent directory structure to location /blog on same server.

c. Please make sure not to copy the entire /var/www/html/blog directory content.



**#22 Linux LogRotate**

The Nautilus DevOps team is ready to launch a new application, which they will deploy on app servers in Stratos Datacenter. They are expecting significant traffic/usage of squid on app servers after that. This will generate massive logs, creating huge log files. To utilise the storage efficiently, they need to compress the log files and need to rotate old logs. Check the requirements shared below:

a. In all app servers install squid package.

b. Using logrotate configure squid logs rotation to monthly and keep only 3 rotated logs.

(If by default log rotation is set, then please update configuration as needed)


**#23 Add Response Headers in Apache**

We are working on hardening Apache web server on all app servers. As a part of this process we want to add some of the Apache response headers for security purpose. We are testing the settings one by one on all app servers. As per details mentioned below enable these headers for Apache:

Install httpd package on App Server 3 using yum and configure it to run on 6300 port, make sure to start its service.

Create an index.html file under Apache's default document root i.e /var/www/html and add below given content in it.

Welcome to the xFusionCorp Industries!

Configure Apache to enable below mentioned headers:

X-XSS-Protection header with value 1; mode=block

X-Frame-Options header with value SAMEORIGIN

X-Content-Type-Options header with value nosniff

Note: You can test using curl on the given app server as LBR URL will not work for this task.

**#24 Configure Local yum repos**

The Nautilus production support team and security team had a meeting last month in which they decided to use local yum repositories for maintaing packages needed for their servers. For now they have decided to configure a local yum repo on Nautilus Backup Server. This is one of the pending items from last month, so please configure a local yum repository on Nautilus Backup Server as per details given below.

a. We have some packages already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms/ on Nautilus Backup Server.

b. Create a yum repo named yum_local and make sure to set Repository ID to yum_local. Configure it to use package's location /packages/downloaded_rpms/.

c. Install package samba from this newly created repo.


**#25 Linux Postfix Mail Server**

xFusionCorp Industries has planned to set up a common email server in Stork DC. After several meetings and recommendations they have decided to use postfix as their mail transfer agent and dovecot as an IMAP/POP3 server. We would like you to perform the following steps:

Install and configure postfix on Stork DC mail server.

Create an email account mariyam@stratos.xfusioncorp.com identified by BruCStnMT5.

Set its mail directory to /home/mariyam/Maildir.

Install and configure dovecot on the same server.


**#26 Install And Configure SFTP**

Some of the developers from Nautilus project team have asked for SFTP access to at least one of the app server in Stratos DC. After going through the requirements, the system admins team has decided to configure the SFTP server on App Server 1 server in Stratos Datacenter. Please configure it as per the following instructions:

a. Create an SFTP user rose and set its password to Rc5C9EyvbU.

b. Password authentication should be enabled for this user.

c. Set its ChrootDirectory to /var/www/nfsshare.

d. SFTP user should only be allowed to make SFTP connections.


**#28 IPtables Installation And Configuration**

We have one of our websites up and running on our Nautilus infrastructure in Stratos DC. Our security team has raised a concern that right now Apacheâ€™s port i.e 8081 is open for all since there is no firewall installed on these hosts. So we have decided to add some security layer for these hosts and after discussions and recommendations we have come up with the following requirements:

Install iptables and all its dependencies on each app host.

Block incoming port 8081 on all apps for everyone except for LBR host.

Make sure the rules remain, even after system reboot.



**#29 Install and Configure Tomcat Server**

The Nautilus application development team recently finished the beta version of one of their Java-based applications, which they are planning to deploy on one of the app servers in Stratos DC. After an internal team meeting, they have decided to use the tomcat application server. Based on the requirements mentioned below complete the task:

a. Install tomcat server on App Server 1 using yum.

b. Configure it to run on port 8086.

c. There is a ROOT.war file on Jump host at location /tmp. Deploy it on this tomcat server and make sure the webpage works directly on base URL i.e without specifying any sub-directory anything like this http://URL/ROOT .


**#30 Linux Process Troubleshooting**

The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries has deployed some of the latest monitoring tools to keep an eye on every service, application, etc. running on the systems. One of the monitoring systems reported about Apache service unavailability on one of the app servers in Stratos DC.

Identify the faulty app host and fix the issue. Make sure Apache service is up and running on all app hosts. They might not hosted any code yet on these servers so you need not to worry about if Apache isn't serving any pages or not, just make sure service is up and running. Also, make sure Apache is running on port 5000 on all app servers.


**#31 PAM Authentication For Apache**

We have a requirement where we want to password protect a directory in the Apache web server document root. We want to password protect http://<website-url>:<apache_port>/protected URL as per the following requirements (you can use any website-url for it like localhost since there are no such specific requirements as of now). Setup the same on App server 1 as per below mentioned requirements:

a. We want to use basic authentication.

b. We do not want to use htpasswd file based authentication. Instead, we want to use PAM authentication, i.e Basic Auth + PAM so that we can authenticate with a Linux user.

c. We already have a user ravi with password YchZHRcLkL which you need to provide access to.

d. You can access the website using APP button on the top bar.


**#32 Install and Configure PostgreSQL**

The Nautilus application development team has shared that they are planning to deploy one newly developed application on Nautilus infra in Stratos DC. The application uses PostgreSQL database, so as a pre-requisite we need to set up PostgreSQL database server as per requirements shared below:

a. Install and configure PostgreSQL database on Nautilus database server.

b. Create a database user kodekloud_top and set its password to dCV3szSGNA.

c. Create a database kodekloud_db3 and grant full permissions to user kodekloud_top on this database.

d. Make appropriate settings to allow all local clients (local socket connections) to connect to the kodekloud_db3 database through kodekloud_top user using md5 method (Please do not try to encrypt password with md5sum).

e. At the end its good to test the db connection using these new credentials from root user or server's sudo user.

**#33 Onboard New Users**

The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries need a script to onboard new users whose names are stored in a csv file `names.csv`..

Create a script that will automatically create users in the environment.
