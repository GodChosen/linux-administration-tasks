## To install httpd on all app servers and enable it to start on boot, I used the following steps.

- Login to servers as root user
=> ssh username@server-name
=> sudo su -

- Install httpd on the server
=> yum install -y httpd
=> yum update

- Start httpd on the server
=> systemctl start httpd

- Enable httpd to start on boot
=> systemctl enable httpd

Note: Use 'apt' instead of 'yum' for Ubuntu distro.
