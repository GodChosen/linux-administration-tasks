## To disable root login on all app servers, we need to set PermitRootLogin to 'No' in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.

- Login to app server as root
=> ssh username@server1
=> sudo su -

- Open the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file
=> vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

- Edit the PermitRootLogin line
=> /PermitRootLogin
=> remove "#" from the line
=> change "Yes" to "No"
=> press :wq followed by Enter keys

- Restart sshd 
=> systemctl restart sshd


Note: Repeat the above for app server 2 & 3.
