## To set up a password-less authentication, I generated a public/private key pair in the jump server and copy the public key to the app servers.

- Generate the key pair in the jump host server
=> ssh-keygen -t rsa

- Copy the public key to the 3 different app servers
=> ssh-copy-id username@server1
=> ssh-copy-id username@server2
=> ssh-copy-id username@server3
